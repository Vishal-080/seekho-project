# _Getting Started_

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**

The following software is required to be installed on your system:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  The following version of Node and Npm are required:

Node 8.x
Npm 3.x

Type the following commands in the terminal to verify your node and npm versions

```
node -v
npm -v
```

- MongoDB

  MongoDB 3.x is required

Type the following command to verify that MongoDB is running on your local machine

```
mongo -version
```

### MongoDB Setup

A running instance of MongoDB is required. Alternatively use a hosted MongoDB from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

#### **Install and Host MongoDB Locally**

Installing MongoDB is relatively straight forward. There are currently 3 platform (Windows, Linux, OSX) releases available and can be found here

For more specific installation instructions, please see the following links:

- [Install MongoDB On Linux](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/administration/install-on-linux/)

- [Install MongoDB On Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

- [Install MongoDB On OSX](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

#### _Third Party Hosting_

---

##### MongoDB Atlas

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is basically a database as a service and is hosted in the cloud. That means that you don't need to install or setup anything to start using MongoDB.

You can get started for free by registering [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). The free tier entitles you to 512MB storage.

Please review the documentation [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/)
